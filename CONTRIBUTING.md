#### Testing
- Run existing tests: `python test_crossbasic.py`
- Test your changes with example programs
- Ensure graphics programs work correctly
- Test on multiple platforms if possible

#### Adding New BASIC Commands
1. Add keyword to `BasicLexer.KEYWORDS`
2. Implement parser method in `BasicParser`
3. Add execution method in `BasicInterpreter`
4. Update documentation
5. Add example usage

#### Adding New Functions
1. Add function to `BasicInterpreter.builtin_functions`
2. Implement the function logic
3. Add documentation
4. Create test examples

#### Pull Requests
- Create clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference related issues
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

## üìù Code Style

### Python Code
```python
# Use descriptive variable names
def parse_expression(self):
    """Parse a mathematical expression."""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Add type hints where appropriate
def evaluate_function(self, name: str, args: List[Any]) -> Any:
    """Evaluate a built-in function."""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### BASIC Code (Examples)
```basic
REM Use clear comments
10 PRINT "Hello World"  REM This prints a greeting
20 LET X = 10          REM Set variable X to 10
30 FOR I = 1 TO X      REM Loop from 1 to X
40   PRINT I          REM Print current number
50 NEXT I             REM End of loop
```

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- Array support (DIM statements)
- String functions (LEFT$, RIGHT$, MID$)
- File I/O operations (OPEN, CLOSE, INPUT#, PRINT#)
- Better error messages and debugging
- Performance optimizations

### Medium Priority
- Sound support (BEEP, PLAY)
- More graphics primitives
- Additional mathematical functions
- Enhanced graphics colors and modes
- Save/Load functionality

### Low Priority
- Syntax highlighting
- IDE integration
- Advanced debugging features
- Plugin system
- Web interface

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

### System Information
