# Line Overwrite Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented line overwrite functionality in the CrossBasic Line Editor. When a line is entered with an already existing line number, it now overwrites that line completely and provides appropriate user feedback.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Program Loading Logic
Modified the `load_program` method in `BasicInterpreter` to:
- Track whether lines are being added or overwritten
- Properly handle the `__lines__` list to avoid duplicates
- Maintain operation results for user feedback

### 2. Operation Tracking System
Added new methods to `BasicInterpreter`:
- `_last_operation_results` dictionary to track add/overwrite operations
- `get_last_line_operation(line_number)` to query operation results
- `clear_operation_results()` to reset tracking between operations

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback
Updated the `BasicEditor` to provide specific feedback:
- **"Line X added to program"** - for new line numbers
- **"Line X overwritten"** - for existing line numbers  
- **"Error adding line to program"** - for syntax or other errors

### 4. Proper Line Management
The `__lines__` list now correctly:
- Detects existing line numbers
- Replaces existing entries instead of appending duplicates
- Maintains program structure integrity

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes to `load_program`
```python
def load_program(self, program_text: str):
    # Track operation results
    self._last_operation_results = {}
    
    for key, value in new_program.items():
        if isinstance(key, int):
            # Check if line number already exists
            line_existed = key in self.program
            self.program[key] = value
            
            # Track operation result
            if line_existed:
                self._last_operation_results[key] = 'overwritten'
            else:
                self._last_operation_results[key] = 'added'
```

### Enhanced Editor Feedback
```python
if self.has_line_number(line):
    self.interpreter.clear_operation_results()
    
    if self.interpreter.load_program(line):
        # Extract line number and show appropriate feedback
        line_number = int(tokens[0].value)
        operation = self.interpreter.get_last_line_operation(line_number)
        
        if operation == 'overwritten':
            print(f"Line {line_number} overwritten")
        elif operation == 'added':
            print(f"Line {line_number} added to program")
```

## Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
Created multiple test scripts to verify functionality:

1. **`test_overwrite.py`** - Basic overwrite functionality
2. **`test_comprehensive_overwrite.py`** - Comprehensive testing scenarios
3. **`demo_overwrite_interactive.py`** - Interactive demonstration

### Test Results Summary
```
✓ New line numbers correctly identified as 'added'
✓ Existing line numbers correctly identified as 'overwritten'  
✓ Program maintains correct line order
✓ Overwritten lines completely replace originals
✓ Invalid syntax rejected without affecting existing lines
✓ Mixed add/overwrite operations work correctly
```

## User Experience Examples

### Before (Previous Behavior)
```
BASIC> 10 PRINT "First"
Line added to program

BASIC> 10 PRINT "Second"  
Line added to program      # Unclear what happened

BASIC> list
10 PRINT "First"           # Duplicate or confusion
10 PRINT "Second"
```

### After (Current Behavior)
```
BASIC> 10 PRINT "First"
Line 10 added to program

BASIC> 10 PRINT "Second"
Line 10 overwritten        # Clear feedback

BASIC> list
10 PRINT "Second"          # Clean, expected result
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Intuitive Behavior**
- Matches user expectations from other BASIC interpreters
- Natural workflow for program development and debugging

### 2. **Clear Feedback**
- Users always know whether they're adding or overwriting
- Reduces confusion about program state

### 3. **Efficient Development**
- No need to delete lines before modifying them
- Supports rapid prototyping and iteration

### 4. **Robust Implementation**
- Proper error handling for syntax errors
- Maintains program integrity
- Cross-platform compatibility

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing programs work unchanged
- All existing features preserved
- File operations work correctly

## Documentation Created

1. **`LINE_OVERWRITE_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive user guide
2. **Enhanced help system** - Updated built-in help
3. **README updates** - Added feature description
4. **Demo scripts** - Interactive examples

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Syntax Errors**
```
BASIC> 10 PRINT "Valid"
Line 10 added to program

BASIC> 10 PRNT "Invalid"
Syntax Error: Parser Error at line 1: Unknown statement: PRNT
# Line 10 remains unchanged
```

### 2. **Non-Sequential Line Numbers**
```
BASIC> 100 PRINT "First"
Line 100 added to program

BASIC> 50 PRINT "Second"  
Line 50 added to program

BASIC> 100 PRINT "Updated"
Line 100 overwritten
# Correct ordering maintained
```

### 3. **Mixed Operations**
- Adding new lines between existing ones
- Overwriting multiple lines in sequence
- Immediate execution alongside program editing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- [ ] Line deletion command (e.g., `DELETE 10`)
- [ ] Line range operations (e.g., `LIST 10-20`)
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Line number auto-increment
- [ ] Bulk line operations

## Conclusion

The line overwrite feature significantly improves the CrossBasic development experience by:

1. **Providing intuitive behavior** that matches user expectations
2. **Offering clear feedback** about add vs. overwrite operations  
3. **Enabling efficient development** workflows
4. **Maintaining robust program management** with proper error handling
5. **Ensuring backward compatibility** with existing functionality

The implementation is thoroughly tested, well-documented, and ready for production use across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
